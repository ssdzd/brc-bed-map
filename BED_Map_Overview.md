# BRC B.E.D. Map - Interactive Burning Man Camp Progress Tracker

## üî• Overview

The BRC B.E.D. Map is an innovative web application that visualizes the Bureau of Erotic Discourse (B.E.D.) program adoption across Black Rock City theme camps. This interactive map transforms the way the Burning Man community tracks and celebrates consent education progress, making it engaging, accessible, and visually stunning.

## üéØ Purpose & Impact

The B.E.D. program educates theme camps about consent culture - a cornerstone value at Burning Man. This map serves as both a progress tracker and a motivational tool, encouraging camps to:

- **Register** for the BEDucator training program
- **Implement** unique consent policies within their camps  
- **Schedule** educational BED talks during the event

By gamifying the adoption process with visual feedback and real-time statistics, the map has significantly increased program participation and awareness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **React 19.1.0** with modern hooks architecture
- **Vite 6.3.5** for lightning-fast development and builds
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.10** for responsive, theme-aware styling
- **Direct SVG manipulation** for efficient map rendering

### Data Layer

- **Live Airtable integration** with authentication and pagination
- **Comprehensive mock data generator** for testing and demos
- **Address normalization system** handling multiple input formats
- **Geographic plaza quarter mapping** with intuitive naming

### Data Pipeline

The map receives real-time updates through an automated data pipeline:

- **BEDtalks.org** - Camps register and progress through the BEDucator program on the main website
- **Zapier automation** - Automatically pushes progress updates from BEDtalks.org to Airtable
- **Airtable database** - Serves as the central data repository with camp information and BED status
- **Map API integration** - Fetches latest data from Airtable with intelligent caching

This seamless integration ensures the map always displays current program participation without manual data entry.

### Performance Optimizations

- **React.memo** applied to frequently re-rendering components
- **Bundle size monitoring** with automated analysis
- **Lazy loading strategies** for assets and data
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper cleanup

### Development Excellence

- **Comprehensive JSDoc documentation** for all components
- **PropTypes validation** for runtime type checking
- **Structured logging system** with environment-aware output
- **GitHub Pages deployment** with automated CI/CD

## üåê Deployment & Integration

### GitHub Pages Hosting

The B.E.D. Map is deployed using GitHub Pages, providing:

- **Free, reliable hosting** directly from the repository
- **Automated deployment** triggered by commits to the main branch
- **HTTPS by default** ensuring secure connections
- **Global CDN** for fast loading worldwide
- **Custom domain support** for professional presentation

### Live Integration on BEDtalks.org

The map is seamlessly integrated into the official BEDtalks.org website:

- **Live deployment** at [bedtalks.org/live-bed-map](https://bedtalks.org/live-bed-map)
- **iframe embedding** allows full functionality within the parent site
- **Responsive sizing** adapts to the container dimensions
- **Cross-origin communication** enables interaction with the parent page
- **Maintained state** preserves user selections and filters

### Deployment Workflow

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions on push to main
```

The iframe integration maintains all interactive features while providing a seamless experience within the BEDtalks.org ecosystem, making the map accessible to the broader Burning Man community.

## üìä Technical Innovations

### Polygon Generation System

Instead of runtime processing, the map uses a sophisticated Python-based polygonizer that:

- Generates precise block geometries from SVG templates
- Optimizes paths for minimal file size
- Validates coverage with visual overlays
- Exports production-ready polygon data

### Smart Address Parsing

The system intelligently handles various address formats:

- Standard format: `"3:45 & C"` or `"C & 3:45"`
- Plaza quarters: `"9:01 & B+"` (geographic naming)
- Malformed inputs: `"3&J"` ‚Üí `"3:00 & J"`
- Time rounding based on street location (30-min vs 15-min intervals)

### Performance Dashboard

Development mode includes a real-time performance monitor tracking:

- Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS)
- Component render times with slow render warnings
- User interaction metrics
- Memory usage monitoring

## üåü User Experience Highlights

### Visual Design

- **Gradient-based theming** matching Burning Man's aesthetic
- **Animated status icons** bringing the legend to life
- **Glow effects** for selected blocks and filtered results
- **Smooth transitions** throughout the interface

### Mobile Experience

- **Responsive panels** that adapt to screen size
- **Touch-optimized controls** for zooming and panning
- **Collapsible legend** maximizing map visibility
- **Mobile-specific UI elements** like the update button

### Accessibility

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** color contrast ratios
- **Full keyboard navigation** with intuitive shortcuts
- **Screen reader support** with semantic HTML and ARIA
- **Focus management** respecting user preferences

## üìà Impact & Results
